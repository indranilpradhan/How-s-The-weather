# How-s-The-weather

Write a bash script that takes the longitude and latitude of a place as command
line arguments and then displays the temperature and weather of that location.
One possible way is to find a suitable website, supply the parameters in the URL,
get its source code and use grep/sed to extract out necessary data.
